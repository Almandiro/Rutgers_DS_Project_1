PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
--------------------

In today's society, heart health is a major concern for many Americans.  This 
concern has lead to the desire for devices that allow one to self-monitor one's
health, specifically, one's own heart health. 

In this project, we'll be evaluating data on Heart Arrythmia's, specifically A-Fib
to understand the contributing factors to the arrhythmia (i.e. age, weight, etc.)

-----------------------
Hypothesis & Questions:
-----------------------

	Null Hypothesis: 	Everyone is equally at risk of suffering from 
				A-Fib, regardless of age

	Alternative Hypothesis:  	A-Fib is more likely in ages greater than 60.

	Questions:
		1. What age group has the highest frequency of heart attacks?
		2. Which gender has the highest frequency of heart attacks?
		3. Does weight affect the likelihood of having a heart attack?
		4. How do different aspects of demographics affect Atrial Fibrillation?
		5. What frequency of Men vs Female suffered Atrial Fibrillation?
