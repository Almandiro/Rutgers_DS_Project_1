PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
--------------------

In today's society, heart health is a major concern for many Americans.  This 
concern has lead to the desire for devices that allow one to self-monitor one's
health, specifically, one's own heart health. 

In this project, we'll be evaluating data on Heart Arrythmia's, specifically A-Fib
to understand the contributing factors to the arrhythmia (i.e. age, weight, etc.)

-----------------------
Hypothesis & Questions:
-----------------------

	Null Hypothesis: 	Everyone is equally at risk of suffering from 
				A-Fib, regardless of age

	Alternative Hypothesis:  	A-Fib is more likely in ages greater than 60.

	Questions:
		1. What age group has the highest frequency of heart attacks?
		2. Which gender has the highest frequency of heart attacks?
		3. Does weight affect the likelihood of having a heart attack?
		4. How do different aspects of demographics affect A-Fib?
		5. What frequency of Men vs Female suffered Atrial Fibrillation?

----------------
ANALYTICAL WORK:
----------------

	Alternative Hypothesis
		The alternative hypothesis (H1) was rejected. Based on our results the Null hypothesis (H0 ) was true.  
		The confidence interval was 0.95 and the degree of freedom was 1. Î± value was 0.05.
		Therefore, as a result, the "NULL Hypothesis" is supported by our data.

	Here's some things we did learn based on the Additional Questions we posed.

		What age group has the highest frequency of heart attacks ?
