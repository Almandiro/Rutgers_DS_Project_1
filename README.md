PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
--------------------

In today's society, heart health is a major concern for many Americans.  This 
concern has lead to the desire for devices that allow one to self-monitor one's
health, specifically, one's own heart health. 

In this project, we'll be evaluating data on Heart Arrythmia's, specifically A-Fib
to understand the contributing factors to the arrhythmia (i.e. age, weight, etc.)

-----------------------
Hypothesis & Questions:
-----------------------

	Null Hypothesis: 	
	-Everyone is equally at risk of suffering from A-Fib, regardless of age

	Alternative Hypothesis:  	
	-A-Fib is more likely in ages greater than 60.

	Questions:
		1. What age group has the highest frequency of heart attacks?
		2. Which gender has the highest frequency of heart attacks?
		3. Does weight affect the likelihood of having a heart attack?
		4. How do different aspects of demographics affect A-Fib?
		5. What frequency of Men vs Female suffered Atrial Fibrillation?
----------------
ATTRIBUTES:
----------------
	1. Age (0-83)
	2.Gender (Male and Female)
	3.Weight (6-176 kg)
	4.Heart Rate
	5.Diagnosis 
	6.Body Mass Index (BMI)
	7.Weight status (based on BMI)
	8.Age bins (based on decade)

----------------
ANALYTICAL WORK:
----------------

	Alternative Hypothesis
		The alternative hypothesis (H1) was rejected. Based on our results the Null hypothesis (H0 ) was true.  
		The confidence interval was 0.95 and the degree of freedom was 1. α value was 0.05.
		Therefore, as a result, the "NULL Hypothesis" is supported by our data.

Here's some things we did learn based on the Additional Questions we posed.
	
	Q: What age group has the highest frequency of heart attacks ?
	A:The data implies that the most freqent age groups where heart arrhythmia is most likely to occur is between the ages of 40-50.

	Q:Does Weight Affect the Likelihood of Having a Heart Attack?
	A:The data implies that the most frequent weight groups where heart arrhythmia is most likely to occur is from 50-74 kg

	Q:Which Gender has the Highest frequency of Heart Attacks?
	A: Based on the data there is a more frequent occurence of heart arrhythmia in females 
	   Females make up 65% of the data while males make up almost 35%.
