Project Descriptions:
---------------------

In today's society, heart health is a major concern for many Americans.  This 
concern has lead to the desire for devices that allow one to self-monitor one's
health, specifically, one's own heart health. 

In this project, we'll be evaulating data on Heart Arrythmia's to understand the
contributing factors to the arrythmia, like possibly age, etc.



Research Questions to Answer

What age group has the highest frequency of heart attacks?
Which gender has the highest frequency of heart attacks?
Does weight affect the likelihood of having a heart attack?
