	11. Students will be able to use Git's stash feature to save "dirty" work.



Project Descriptions:
---------------------

	In today's society, heart health is a major concern for many Americans.  This 
	concern has lead to the desire for devices that allow one to self-monitor one's
	health, specifically, one's own heart health. 

	In this project, we'll be evaulating data on Heart Arrythmia's to understand the
	contributing factors to the arrythmia, like possibly age, etc.


NULL HYPOTHESIS:
----------------
	Everyone is equally at risk of suffering from A-Fib, regardless of age.


ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS:
-----------------------
	A-Fib is more likely in ages greater than 60.

RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
-------------------
	1. How do different aspects of demographics affect Atrial Fibrillation?
	2. What frequency of Men vs Female suffered Atrial Fibrillation?
	3. What age group has the highest frequency of heart attacks?
	4. Which gender has the highest frequency of heart attacks?
	5. Does weight affect the likelihood of having a heart attack?
